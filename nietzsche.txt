Part 9 What is noble?

Every enhancement so far in the type “man” has been the work of an
aristocratic society – and that is how it will be, again and again, since this
sort of society believes in a long ladder of rank order and value distinctions
between men, and in some sense needs slavery. Without the pathos of
distance as it grows out of the ingrained differences between stations, out
of the way the ruling caste maintains an overview and keeps looking down
on subservient types and tools, and out of this caste’s equally continuous
exercisein obeying and commanding, in keeping away and below –without
this pathos, that other, more mysterious pathos could not have grown at
all, that demand for new expansions of distance within the soul itself,
the development of states that are increasingly high, rare, distant, tautly
drawn and comprehensive, and in short, the enhancement of the type
“man,” the constant “self-overcoming of man” (to use a moral formula in
a supra-moral sense). Of course, you cannot entertain any humanitarian
illusions about how an aristocratic society originates (and any elevation
of the type “man” will presuppose an aristocratic society –): the truth is
harsh. Let us not be deceived about how every higher culture on earth
has begun!
